        Lil Nas X is the stage name for Montero Lamar Hill, an American rapper and singer, 
        whose single “Old Town Road” holds the record for number of weeks at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart 
        and is the only openly queer black artist to win a Country Music Association award.
        Lil Nas X's debut full-length studio album, MONTERO, was released on September 17th, 2021, to large commercial and critical success.
        Throughout this post I will examine MONTERO through a queer lens, 
        especially with a focus on how the expression of his identity as a black gay man can be important representation for his audience, 
        and how the composition of the music supports this theme.
      </p>
      <h3>Before the album: Twitter, “C7osure” and “HOLIDAY”</h3>
      <p>
        On June 30th, 2019, Lil Nas X publicly came out as gay via Twitter.
        This was right off the back of his EP 7, which was released a week and a half earlier.
        His next release was the non-album single “HOLIDAY” released on November 13th, 2020.
        This track, his first release since coming out, featured fairly braggadocious lyrics, including one reference to his sexuality within the lyrics.
        A few months later, after slowly drumming up hype through social media, on March 26th, 2021,
        Lil Nas X released the first single and corresponding video for his upcoming album.
      </p>
      <h3>“MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name):” Out and Proud</h3>
      <p>
        After slowly drumming up hype through social media, on March 26th, 2021, Lil Nas X released the first single and corresponding video for his upcoming album: “MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name).”
        Starting with just the title, it references the very popular 2007 novel and 2017 film about a queer romance.
        As opposed to the subtle nods in his previous songs, the lyrics in “MONTERO (Call My By Your Name)” bring attention to the fact that it is a gay song and make no attempt to be subtle.
        “Cocaine and drinking with your friends / You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend / I’m not fazed, only here to sin / If Eve ain’t in your garden, you know that you can / Call me when you want / Call me when you need / Call me in the morning, I’ll be on the way.” 
        The song itself is about a relationship with a closeted man, with lyrics like, “Tell me you love me in private” speaking to that experience.
        This form of explicit, stated queerness is incredibly rare in pop music, and giving it this large platform allows many queer people, especially gay black men, to be represented. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast to the simpler message and story of the song, 
        the music video for “MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name)” uses biblical references to form a narrative meant to specifically target religious homophobia and reclaim the imagery.
        The video is an embrace of sin as defined by the religious right, using their ideas and imagery and forming those as parts of his identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        This level of reclamation is also present within the music itself.
        Musically, the song is fairly straightforward. 
        After an opening acoustic guitar riff that outlines the chords G#m and D#, 
        the song begins to oscillate between the chords D# and E, and it continues going between those chords for the rest of the song, 
        never going back to the G#m from the introduction. 
        Because of this lack of G#m, despite these chords all existing within the G# harmonic minor scale, 
        I think it is more useful to think of the song as existing within the fifth mode of that scale, Phrygian dominant. 
        This is supported through a few aspects of the song. 
        The chord loop takes two measures to complete, and the placement of the chords for those measures are as follows: ||: D# E | E D# :||. 
        The D# chords within this loop take up both the first and last spot within each two measure-section, 
        and the song strongly emphasizes these two-measure phrases with both the melody and the instrumentation. 
        For the melody of the song, during the verses (specifically the second half of the first verse and all of the second verse) 
        and prechorus there is an emphasis on the note G#, but that is contrasted with the chorus. 
        During the verses and prechorus the instrumentation is more sparse, and when the chorus kicks in, 
        the other instruments fill out the mix and create a much more driving rhythm, 
        and this is paired with a melody made up almost entirely of D#’s and E’s. 
        This emphasis on the D# during the most exciting sections of the song cements the D# as the tonic of the song, 
        and places this song squarely within D# Phrygian dominant. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite being commonly used across many cultures around the world, 
        Phrygian dominant is rarely used within western music and can take on a ‘sinister’ tone for those in cultures not used to the scale. 
        This song, first and foremost, is an expression of love and joy, and by utilizing a less standard scale, 
        Lil Nas X is positioning his love and joy in opposition to the existing cultural norms. 
        Just as the term queer, once only used as a slur, is now being used regularly as a simple descriptor, 
        especially within the realm of academia, Lil Nas X seeks to reclaim these homophobic ideas into an identity he can forge for himself.
      </p>
      <h3>“SUN GOES DOWN:” The Pain of a Closet</h3>
      <p>
        After the explosive first single, the anticipation was high for Lil Nas X’s next release, 
        but instead of releasing another huge pop hit, he released “SUN GOES DOWN.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “SUN GOES DOWN” is a much more subdued song in A major about the pain he felt when he was younger and in the closet. 
        The song opens with its chorus and the lyrics, “I wanna run away / Don’t wanna lie, I don’t want a life / Send me a gun, and I’ll see the sun.”
        This speaks to the queer pain at being closeted, and to the very high rates of suicidal thoughts among queer youth. 
        The melody of this chorus stays pretty stable on a C#, and only on the last line does it leave. 
        This droning note creates a feeling of tension that is only resolved with the lyric about release. 
        Within the key of the song, the note C# is the third scale degree, the mediant. 
        It is a note caught in the middle, between the resolved tonic and the directional dominant. 
        When queer people are forced into the closet, 
        the struggle between their own safety and their desire to be their authentic selves are at complete odds with each other, 
        and it is a battle fought alone. 
        This C# drone crops up throughout the song, and with it comes the tension and unresolved nature of the note. 
        “It's hard for you when you're fightin' / And nobody knows it when you're silent.” 
        There is often a desire to be ‘normal’ as well because it would make life that much easier. 
        “These gay thoughts would always haunt me / I prayed God would take it from me.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Within the closet, many queer youth find community online, where they can remain anonymous and their identities can’t compromise their safety. 
        “I'd be by the phone / Stanning Nicki mornin' into dawn/ Only place I felt like I belonged / Strangers make you feel so loved you know.”
        This refuge into online spaces can be life-saving for many queer people, 
        as it gives them an outlet to be themselves where it isn’t actively dangerous to their person. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Although online spaces can serve as a great refuge, 
        eventually the need to be their authentic selves drives most queer people into starting to live as their authentic selves, 
        though this avenue is never easy, nor one given to all queer people. 
        “And I'm happy by the way / That I made that jump, that leap of faith / I'm happy that it all worked out for me/ I'mma make my fans so proud of me.”
        With that last line, the C# that has been droning in portions throughout the song finally gets to resolve down to A, the tonic. 
        This resolution of the melody is paired with the resolution of all the pain and hiding. 
        The melody resolves home, and Lil Nas X lives as his authentic self.
      </p>
      <h3>“INDUSTRY BABY:” Queering the Hyper-Masculine</h3>
      <p>
        The next and final single released in anticipation of the album was “INDUSTRY BABY.” 
        In contrast to both “MONTERO” and “SUN GOES DOWN,” “INDUSTRY BABY” is not explicitly about the queer experience, yet even so, 
        within this song there is still the casual assertion of his sexuality and the fact that it is an intrinsic part of his identity and his person. 
        This fits with what he has said in interviews about “MONTERO” and “HOLIDAY” 
        about being able to be out and gay in the same way heterosexual rap and pop stars are able to be open with their straightness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The music video for “INDUSTRY BABY” follows a prison break made by Lil Nas X and Jack Harlow, 
        the other featured rapper on this song. 
        In the commentary for the music video, Lil Nas X said, 
        “I wanted to go to a place people would least expect me to go in a music video. An overly masculine place and make it gay.”
        Through his overt queerness both through references in the song and music, 
        Lil Nas X is able to subvert the traditionally very masculine setting and turn it into a story about queer liberation. 
        “I … wanted to visualize the theme of breaking free from the shackles society places on you.” 
        Throughout “INDUSTRY BABY” there is prominent use of horns. 
        These horns form the backbone of the song and are the only instruments at all outside of Lil Nas X and Jack Harlow’s voice and electronic drums and bass. 
        Brass instruments, historically, have been considered to be overtly masculine, and that generalization is one that has persisted into the modern day. 
        By using this masculine instrumentation, Lil Nas X is able to perform the same subversion as the music video, 
        bringing queerness into a traditionally masculine and heterosexual domain.
      </p>
      <h3>“TALES OF DOMINICA:” The Broken Home</h3>
      <p>
        Finally, on September 17th, 2021, the album MONTERO was released worldwide.
        Throughout the album, Lil Nas X makes many references to his broken home.
        These references are most prominent on the song “TALES OF DOMINICA.” 
        “Woke up on the floor / Oh this plastic bed don’t blow up no more / In this broken home / everyone becomes predictable.”
        When he was six, Lil Nas X’s parents divorced, and he moved in with his mother and grandmother in Atlanta. 
        When he was nine, he and his brother moved in with their father in the suburbs. 
        After that point, his relationship with his mother became nearly non-existent as she would also call very infrequently.
        The reason for this estrangement is not about his queerness, but the sentiments invoked are still very common to the queer experience.
        Many queer people estranged from their family can feel comfort in the solidarity of knowing that there are others also going through their struggles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout “TALES OF DOMINICA” Lil Nas X uses two distinct vocal registers, one fairly low in his range, and one fairly high.
        The lower register is used to narrate the deeply personal and internal thoughts of the situation he was in.
        “I’ve been living on an island made from fate / Can’t go running back to home I can’t face her face.” 
        This is contrasted with the higher register which is used for a more detached narration,
        as if looking at the situation through hindsight, or merely through a dissociative fugue.
        “Sometimes you're angry / Sometimes you're hurting / Sometimes you're all alone.”
        During the verse, however, Lil Nas X is singing in octaves with himself,
        with one voice existing in the lower register, and the other in the higher register.
        This melding of perspectives is also evident in the lyrics.
        “Oh, finally grown, ain't nothing like I hopеd it would be / Out on my own, I'm floating in an oceanless sea.”
        This combination of perspectives coincides with the deeply personal statement looking both to the past with the eyes of hindsight
        and to the present with all the emotions he still carries from his history.
      </p>
      <h3>“LIFE AFTER SALEM:” Unstable Relationships</h3>
      <p>
        As with everyone, queer people don’t always have the happiest or healthiest relationships,
        and this can be compounded through the marginalization queer people feel,
        doubly so for additional axes of oppression, including race. 
        An exploration of these unpleasant relationships is the focus of the penultimate song on MONTERO: “LIFE AFTER SALEM.”
        “All of my feelings are gone / I left them all on the floor / Man, who's to blame if you don't love me no more? … Why don't you just take what you want from me? / I think you should take what you want and leave.” 
      </p>
      <p>
        This relationship dynamic is explored in the most aggressive song on the album. 
        The pop aesthetic is replaced with a sound much closer to rock music. 
        The backbone of this song rests on this two bar loop: ||: C5 Ab | Gmaj7 Eb+ :||, played by a jangly, slightly distorted guitar. 
        The chords in the second bar of the pattern are far more dissonant than the rest of the album,
        be it in the sharp dissonance of the major seventh interval or in the non-diatonic triad of the augmented chord,
        which is the most dissonant-sounding triad. 
        These dissonances combined with the subtle distortion on the guitar create a sour and unpleasant sound for the back half of the chord progression.
        This unstable bed gets expanded upon through the instrumentation, but throughout the song this tense guitar loop lies beneath.
      </p>
      <p>
        This fundamental instability helps support the lyrical subject of the song.
        “Throw me up against the wall / And kick me when I have to crawl / Ooh, I love it when you show no love at all.”
        This relationship is fundamentally broken, and thus the song itself sounds broken.
        Even in its loud, bombastic choruses there is something unstable here, something unpleasant, something wrong.
      </p>
      <h3>“AM I DREAMING:” Queer Excellence</h3>
      <p>
        The final song of MONTERO is “AM I DREAMING” featuring fellow queer pop icon Miley Cyrus.
        The song follows the idea of both artists wanting to leave a legacy and be remembered for their art.
        “Never forget me / and everything I’ve done.” 
        This sort of ambitious thinking is very reminiscent of a queer drive for excellence.
        Queerphobes can create a drive in many queer people for extreme excellence.
        “Never forget me, like I’m your favorite song.”
        This drive has created the pressure for an impossible legacy.
        They want not just their music to be immortal, but they need themselves to be immortalized for all time.
        This drive leads the album to end with Lil Nas X asking for the audience to never forget him “and everything [he’s] done.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The instrumentation of “AM I DREAMING” very subtly changes and expands throughout. 
        At the start it is just Lil Nas X and an acoustic guitar. 
        Then, going into the chorus, subtly a bass and string creep up into the mix. 
        For the next verse, sung by Miley Cyrus, those instruments stay, albeit more subdued than before, 
        but then they crescendo into the final chorus where Miley Cyrus and Lil Nas X sing together. 
        The song finally ends with the high frequencies all being filtered out and being overtaken by reverb. 
        This growing instrumentation coincides with the impossible standards these artists are holding themselves to, 
        but as the song collapses into reverb, we are left with nothing but the memory.
      </p>
      <h3>MONTERO, a Queer Experience</h3>
      <p>
        The album MONTERO encapsulates many aspects of Lil Nas X’s life and experience through the medium of song. 
        It is a look at one queer man's life, but in that life, so many commonalities with the queer experience jump out. 
        He began the album’s release cycle by telling people about how, while in the world we may hide truths about ourselves, here, in MONTERO, he would lay it all bare. 
        In doing so, he gave his perspective on the queer experience that many intimately understand. 
        His story on MONTERO, told not only through lyrics but also in the musical composition of each song, 
        becomes not only a reflection of his own experiences but a lens through which queer people can see their own experiences refracted back at them. 
        From the triumphant verses of “INDUSTRY BABY” and “DOLLA SIGN SLIME” to the songs of love and longing like “MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name)” and “THAT’S WHAT I WANT,” 
        MONTERO, with its deeply personal lyrical themes and potently placed compositional techniques, says to its queer audience: you are not abnormal and you are not alone.
